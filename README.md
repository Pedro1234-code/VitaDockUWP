# DockVitaUWP

DockVitaUWP allows you to display your PS vita or any USB camera device on UWP platforms such as the Xbox consoles.

Press Menu button on the Xbox controller connected to the Xbox for a few seconds to open the settings menu. There you can choose between supported resolutions for the Vita.

Note that this app doesn't allow you to control the vita using the Xbox controller. In order to do it, you need an Xbox One controller and the X1Vita plugin.
